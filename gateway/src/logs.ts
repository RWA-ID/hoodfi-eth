/**
 * `eth_getLogs` over a range wider than the RPC will answer in one request.
 *
 * The Robinhood Chain RPC refuses any log query spanning more than 10,000,000 blocks
 * (inclusive) with -32602 'narrow the block range'. Blocks come fast enough that every
 * 'from the deploy block to latest' query in this repo crossed that line on its own —
 * no code change, just a chain growing past it — and each one failed from then on.
 *
 * So the range is split into fixed windows, read a few at a time, and joined back in
 * block order. Any window failing fails the whole read: a list assembled from the
 * windows that happened to answer would drop names without saying so, which is the
 * failure these callers exist to avoid.
 *
 * Kept in step with frontend/lib/logs.ts and gateway/src/logs.ts — three apps, three
 * deploys, one rule.
